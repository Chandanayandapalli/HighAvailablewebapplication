Creating a Highly Available Web Application with Amazon Web Services 

** INTRODUCTION**
To build and manage a highly available web application in AWS, it'simportant to balance cost-effectiveness with peak performance, use moderncloud architecture best practices, and take advantage of AWS services tosimplify management tasks. By deploying across multiple availability zones,using auto-scaling groups, and using tools such as AWS Cloud Formation,Elastic Beanstalk, and Lambda, you can streamline deployment, monitoring,and troubleshooting to maintain a healthy application.When it comes to running a successful business, achieving high availability,minimising downtime, scalability, fault tolerance, automated management,security and compliance, monitoring, and analytics are all crucial objectivesto meet.High availability means that your system is up and running at all times, whichis essential for your business to operate smoothly. Minimising downtime isalso important as it ensures that any issues that arise are resolved quickly,and your system is back up and running as soon as possible.Scalability is important as your business grows, and your system needs to beable to handle increased traffic and usage. Fault tolerance is crucial as itensures that your system is resilient to any faults or errors that may occur.Automated management is essential as it allows your system to runefficiently and effectively without manual intervention. Security andcompliance are also critical objectives to meet as they ensure that yoursystem is secure and meets regulatory requirements.Finally, monitoring and analytics are essential as they allow you to monitoryour system's performance, identify any issues that may arise and makedata-driven decisions to improve your system's performance and efficiency.By meeting all these objectives, you can ensure that your business runs
smoothly, efficiently, and effectively.


**REQUIREMENTS**
To launch a highly available web application in Amazon Web Services(AWS), you need to design your infrastructure with fault tolerance andredundancy in mind. AWS offers a variety of services and best practicesto achieve high availability.

Here's a general guideline for the key components and steps:

➢ An authorised AWS account with adequate permissions to configureand provide a robust Highly Available Web Application.

➢ Multiple Availability Zones - Deploy your application across multipleAWS Availability Zones within a region. This ensures that if one AZexperiences issues, your application can continue running in another AZ.

➢ AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) to configure a new VPC, publicsubnets, an Internet Gateway and Route Table.

➢ AWS EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute) to create a Launch Template, anAuto Scaling Group and the Elastic Load Balancer.

➢ Elastic Load Balancer (ELB):Use an Elastic Load Balancer to distributetraffic across multiple instances. This can be the Classic Load Balancer,Application Load Balancer, or Network Load Balancer, depending on yourneeds.

➢ Auto Scaling - Set up Auto Scaling groups to automatically adjust thenumber of instances in response to traffic demands. This helps ensurethat your application can handle increased loads without manualintervention.

➢ Amazon RDS Multi-AZ - If you use a relational database, use AmazonRDS with Multi-AZ deployment for database high availability. Thisreplicates your database to a standby instance in another AZ for failover.

➢ Security - Implement security best practices, such as using AWSIdentity and Access Management (IAM), Network Security Groups(NSGs), and encryption for data at rest and in transit.

➢ Content Delivery - Use Amazon CloudFront for content delivery.CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that caches your contentat edge locations, reducing latency and increasing availability.

➢ Amazon S3 for Static Assets - Store static assets (e.g., images, CSS,JavaScript) in Amazon S3 for durability and scalability. You can also useS3 to host static websites.

➢ High Availability Databases - consider services like Amazon RDB,which provides high availability and scalability out of the box.

➢ Monitoring and Alerts - Set up AWS Cloud Watch for monitoring yourresources and creating alarms for automated responses. Cloud Watchcan also be integrated with AWS Lambda for auto scaling or other
automated actions
